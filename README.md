Hey everyone, I'm David! an aspiring Software Engineer. Born and raised in Tel Aviv, Israel, moved to the USA after college and joined world class companies as an analytical thinker. I enjoy  and learning about pretty much everything. 

In my spare time I create music and podcast about healthy self optimization habits.
