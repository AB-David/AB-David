# Hey everyone 
I'm David! an aspiring Software Engineer. Born and raised in Tel Aviv, Israel, moved to the USA after college and love building tech to elevate people. I enjoy creating things and learning about pretty much anything. 

In my spare time I create music and podcast about healthy self-optimization habits.
